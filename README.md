# Starter Project

Welcome! This is a starter project for the meetup presentation!

If you're new to Git then you've come to the right place. By the end of the presentation you'll be able to contribute to some of the most used technologies in the world such as Docker, Linux, FreeCodeCamp and Elasticsearch.
If you're already familiar with Git, skip to this section

## Now what?

Well done, you've mastered Git! Now you're ready to start contributing any project on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket - they all use the same technology - git!

The next step is to start work on either your own project or, even better, an open source one. This will expose you to other peoples code and give you good working practise when you get on a job.
Depending on the language you use, there are some projects you can contribute to and resources to find projects.

### Find Projects of Any Language

### Java

### Python

### .NET Core
