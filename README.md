# Starter Project

Welcome! This is a starter project for the meetup presentation!

If you're new to Git then you've come to the right place. By the end of the presentation you'll be able to contribute to some of the most used technologies in the world such as Docker, Linux, FreeCodeCamp and Elasticsearch.
If you're already familiar with Git, skip to this section

## How do I start?
* Click the "Fork" button
* After the fork is complete, copy the URL of the repository by clicking "Clone or Download"
* Run the command `git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/starter.git` in your terminal
* Open the folder in your favourite editor
* Add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file
* Go back in your terminal and add your files, commit them and then push them!
  - e.g., `git add -A && git commit -m "Feature Added My Name!" && git push -u origin master`
* Go to your forked repository in your browser (e.g., https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/starter)
* Click the "Pull Request" button - just under the "Clone or Download" button
* Submit your Pull Request!

## Now what?

Well done, you've mastered Git! Now you're ready to start contributing any project on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket - they all use the same technology - git!

The next step is to start work on either your own project or, even better, an open source one. This will expose you to other peoples code and give you good working practise when you get on a job.
Depending on the language you use, there are some projects you can contribute to and resources to find projects.
